"A particular case of the half cadence is the Phrygian half cadence. It "

"A scale starts with the note that names the key, the tonic. This note is the "

"major chord, the chord built on the note A. It often also begins on that "
"chord, returns to that chord often, and features a melody and a bass line "
"that also return to the note A often enough that listeners will know where "

"A scale, from Latin word 'scala' meaning 'ladder', is a predefined series of "
"notes going up (ascending) or down (descending). People in different musical "
"traditions have different ideas about what notes they think sound best "
"together. In the Western musical tradition - which includes most familiar "
"music from Europe and the Americas - the octave is divided up into twelve "
"equally spaced notes. Other musical traditions - traditional Chinese music "
"for example - have divided the octave differently and so they use different "
"scales."
